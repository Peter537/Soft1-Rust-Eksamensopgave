## Question
Module System and Code Organization: Rust’s module system aids in organizing large codebases. How did you utilize this system to structure your project’s code? Explain your use of pub, mod, and other visibility qualifiers to manage encapsulation and modularity.

## Code Snippet:
main.rs
```rust
mod backend;
mod database;
mod model;
mod ui;
mod util;
```

database/mod.rs
```rust
pub mod circuit;
pub mod config;
mod connection;
pub mod country;
pub mod driver;
pub mod race;
pub mod teams;
```

backend/race.rs public and private functions
```rust
pub fn start_race(season_schedule_id: u16) {
 [...]
}

fn generate_driver_lap_times(
    [...]
) -> [...]
```


for super keyword e.g choose_team_screen.rs and table.rs    
```rust
use super::AppState;
```
```rust
use super::super::AppState;
```
