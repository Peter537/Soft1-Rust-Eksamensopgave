## Question
Strings and String Handling in Rust: In Rust, the handling of strings is different to languages like Java C# - especially about mutability and ownership. Discuss how you managed strings in your project. What challenges did you face with String and &str types? Provide examples of where you optimised string usage for performance or memory efficiency (you could discuss the use of &’static str or [A]rc<str> where lots of cloning is needed) 

## Code Snippet:

src/model/driver.rs
```rust
pub struct Driver {
    pub id: u16,
    pub first_name: String,
    pub last_name: String,
    // ...
}
```

This allows Driver to be moved or returned without worrying about lifetimes.


database/driver.rs
```rust
pub fn get_driver_id_by_fullname(full_name: &str) -> Option<u16> {
    let conn = get_connection().unwrap();
    let mut stmt = conn
        .prepare("SELECT id FROM drivers WHERE first_name || ' ' || last_name = ?")
        .unwrap();
    let row = stmt.query_row([full_name], |row| row.get(0));
    match row {
        Ok(id) => Some(id),
        Err(_) => None,
    }
}
```

src/util/appdata.rs
```rust
const REPO: &str = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peter537/Soft1-Rust-Eksamensopgave/main";
```

```rust
static CONFIG_PATH: Lazy<PathBuf> = Lazy::new(|| BASE_PATH.join("Config"));

const CARS: [&str; 10] = [
