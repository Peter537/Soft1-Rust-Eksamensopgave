## Question
Ownership and Borrowing Concepts: Explain the concept of ownership and borrowing in Rust. How did these features influence the design and functionality of your project? Provide examples of how managing ownership and borrowing helped improve your code’s safety or performance. What are some of the common problems you encountered using the Rust Ownership and Borrowing model? 

## Code Snippet:

model/driver.rs
```rust
pub struct Driver {
    pub first_name: String,
    pub last_name: String,
    // ...
}
```

Struct fields are owned types (`String`), so instances of `Driver` can be freely moved or stored.

backend/race.rs
```rust
pub fn start_race(season_schedule_id: u16) {
    let race = get_season_schedule_by_id(&season_schedule_id).unwrap();
    let circuit = get_circuit_by_id(&race.circuit_id).unwrap();
    let drivers = get_all_drivers();

    let driver_lap_times =
        generate_driver_lap_times(&drivers, circuit.lap_amount, circuit.length_km);

    let driver_total_times = calculate_driver_total_times(&driver_lap_times);

    let driver_results = create_driver_results(&driver_total_times, &driver_lap_times);

    save_driver_results(season_schedule_id, driver_results);
    update_race_status(season_schedule_id, "Finished");
}
```


database/driver.rs
```rust
pub fn get_driver_id_by_fullname(full_name: &str) -> Option<u16> {
    let conn = get_connection().unwrap();
    let mut stmt = conn
        .prepare("SELECT id FROM drivers WHERE first_name || ' ' || last_name = ?")
        .unwrap();
    let row = stmt.query_row([full_name], |row| row.get(0));
    match row {
        Ok(id) => Some(id),
        Err(_) => None,
    }
}
```


ui/mod.rs
```rust
fn build_navbar() -> impl Widget<AppState> {
    let home_button = Button::new("Home").on_click(|ctx, data: &mut AppState, _env| {
        data.current_screen = MainGameScreen;
        ctx.request_update();
    });
```
+ main.rs
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), PlatformError> {
    let main_window = WindowDesc::new(ui::build_ui()).title("Formula One Manager");
    AppLauncher::with_window(main_window)
        .delegate(MyAppDelegate::new())
        .launch(AppState::default())
        .expect("Failed to launch application");

    Ok(())
}
```
