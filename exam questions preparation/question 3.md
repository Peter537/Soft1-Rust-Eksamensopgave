## Question 3

Strings and String Handling in Rust: In Rust, the handling of strings is different to languages like Java C# - especially about mutability and ownership. Discuss how you managed strings in your project. What challenges did you face with String and &str types?
Provide examples of where you optimised string usage for performance or memory efficiency (you could discuss the use of `&’static str` or `[A]rc<str>` where lots of cloning is needed)
