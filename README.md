## Installation Guide

**IMPORTANT**: The project has only been tested on Windows. It might not work on other operating systems.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the project, either
    - using `cargo r` in the terminal
    - or running the [formula_one_manager.exe](./formula_one_manager.exe) file 
3. Play the game!

If you're running the program the first time, it downloads 94 files from [/mod](./mod/) in our GitHub repository, so it can take a couple of seconds to start. But after that, it should be fast.
